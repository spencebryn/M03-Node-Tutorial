WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Bender, we're trying our best. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Why did you bring us here? Hello Morbo, how's the family? Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

    And when we woke up, we had these bodies.
    Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
    Professor, make a woman out of me.

Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

You can see how I lived before I met you. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Is that a cooking show? We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!

    You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?
    Large bet on myself in round one.
    One hundred dollars.

No, I'm Santa Claus! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Soon enough. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

Noooooo! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. You're going to do his laundry?

We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Kids have names? No, she'll probably make me do it.

Hey, whatcha watching? Kif might! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. We're rescuing ya.

Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Is the Space Pope reptilian!? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Shut up and get to the point! But I've never been to the moon! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

Anyone who laughs is a communist! Guess again. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. I'll get my kit!

It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Can we have Bender Burgers again? What are their names?

Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

Noooooo! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. You're going to do his laundry?

We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Kids have names? No, she'll probably make me do it.

Hey, whatcha watching? Kif might! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. We're rescuing ya.

Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Is the Space Pope reptilian!? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Shut up and get to the point! But I've never been to the moon! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

Anyone who laughs is a communist! Guess again. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. I'll get my kit!

It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Can we have Bender Burgers again? What are their names?
WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Bender, we're trying our best. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Why did you bring us here? Hello Morbo, how's the family? Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

    And when we woke up, we had these bodies.
    Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
    Professor, make a woman out of me.

Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

You can see how I lived before I met you. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Is that a cooking show? We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!

    You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?
    Large bet on myself in round one.
    One hundred dollars.

No, I'm Santa Claus! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

    And when we woke up, we had these bodies.
    Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
    Professor, make a woman out of me.

Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

You can see how I lived before I met you. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Is that a cooking show? We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!

    You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?
    Large bet on myself in round one.
    One hundred dollars.

No, I'm Santa Claus! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Soon enough. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?

Noooooo! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. You're going to do his laundry?

We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Kids have names? No, she'll probably make me do it.

Hey, whatcha watching? Kif might! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. We're rescuing ya.

Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Is the Space Pope reptilian!? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Shut up and get to the point! But I've never been to the moon! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

Anyone who laughs is a communist! Guess again. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. I'll get my kit!

It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Can we have Bender Burgers again? What are their names?
WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Bender, we're trying our best. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Why did you bring us here? Hello Morbo, how's the family? Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp.

We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Kids have names? No, she'll probably make me do it.

Hey, whatcha watching? Kif might! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. We're rescuing ya.

Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Is the Space Pope reptilian!? It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?

You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Shut up and get to the point! But I've never been to the moon! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.

Anyone who laughs is a communist! Guess again. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. I'll get my kit!

It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.

Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Can we have Bender Burgers again? What are their names?
WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Bender, we're trying our best. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Why did you bring us here? Hello Morbo, how's the family? Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!

The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

    And when we woke up, we had these bodies.
    Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
    Professor, make a woman out of me.

Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

You can see how I lived before I met you. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Is that a cooking show? We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!

    You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?
    Large bet on myself in round one.
    One hundred dollars.

No, I'm Santa Claus! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Soon enough. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.
